<h2> About me</h1>
   <p>I am a rising senior in highschool and I am learning how to code!<br> I love animals so I will dedicate some of this page to them</p>

  <h3> PYTHTON VS. SCRATCH</h3>
  <p>Scracth is much more straightforward compared to python, which requires you to do more research.<br>
    However, they are both really fun to use and you can get them to do many things. <br>
    Also, when working with Python I would get more fustraated because the error in your code is not always clear to you.</p>
